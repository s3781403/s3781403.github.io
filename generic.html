							<h2>My interest in I.T</h2>
							<!-- <h3></h3> -->
							<p>I’m interested in learning all that I can about the world of I.T. I find that a lot of the recent advancements in technology are very exciting, and would love to be on the forefront of discovering and utilizing new inventions. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, robotics, and networks are all fascinating areas to me. If I’m able, they are definitely areas I’d be interested in exploring more.</p>
							<p>I think that mostly what sparked my interest in IT was a combination of my dad working on cool sounding projects all the time, my own desire for exploration & creation, and science fiction movies (some of the things in them seem so cool! Maybe one day I can make stuff like that). 
</p>
							<p>I’ve got a little background in programming, as I learnt a little bit of python, html, and batch when I was younger. Where possible, I’d love to expand my knowledge of lots of different languages, as I think that the things you can do with them are super cool, and the differences between them (as well as the similarities) have always intrigued me. </p>
							<p>To be brutally honest, before coming to study at RMIT, I’d never even visited the campus, attended any open days, or read a brochure on what they have to offer. I was putting in my uni preferences and heard from my uncle that RMIT is a good place to study IT. However, despite my initial ambivalence towards the Uni, I’m so glad that I ended up coming here, as the campus is awesome, (seriously, so cool. Can’t get over it), the teachers are great, and the rest of my cohort is pretty cool too. I’m definitely looking forward to however many years that I have left here. </p>
							<p>I hope to learn as much as I can about pretty much everything RMIT is offering. I think that if I can have good, practical skills surrounding software development, system management, databases, and networks once I’ve finished here, then I’ll be happy with what I have learnt. I expect that RMIT teaches the important skills and knowledge for working in a career in IT.
