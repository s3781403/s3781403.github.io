									<h2>Information about my ideal job</h2>
									<p>    To me this job is a combination of a consultant and a solutions architect. Which means providing creative solutions for existing telecommunications networks and helping both customers and stakeholders with improving their position in the market. It also states acting as an internal consultant for other IT areas as well, which I think could be really interesting.</p>
									<p>    This position is appealing to me because it seems to be both challenging and rewarding. I enjoy talking to people and being social, so a job that involves me helping others and being involved with people from lots of different areas is an exciting prospect. There also may be opportunities to travel around to different countries and help people with issues, as Ericsson is an international corporation. I also love Sweden, which is convenient, as the job is based there.</p>
									<p>    This is not an entry level job, as such it requires a minimum of 10 years of experience in IT Security and Network, and expertise within the areas of security, enterprise network, wifi, certificates and the cloud (IBM, Amazon, Azure). Education must be in computer science or similar.</p>
									<p>    Right now, I have a very rudimentary understanding of how the internet and networks work, very little knowledge of cloud based computing and security. I also have no years of experience in a professional IT work environment. I am, of course, completely underqualified for this job.</p>
									<p>    In order to gain the qualifications necessary to get this job, I hope to continue my education at RMIT, majoring in the necessary areas (I believe networks and security) which should hopefully leave me with the knowledge necessary to gain a job in a similar field once I graduate from university. I then hope to work diligently and improve my knowledge on all the areas that I can, so as to best improve my chances of getting into a similar career. I think most jobs will have changed a lot in 15 years, but Iâ€™m sure that there will be something equally as interesting in the same field that I can acquire.</p>
